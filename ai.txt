Project Title: AI-Powered News Article Summarizer

In this project, we developed an AI-based text summarization application that automatically generates concise summaries from lengthy news articles, research papers, and documents. The summarizer utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF-based sentence scoring to identify and extract the most informative sentences from a given text. Users can choose different summary lengths — short, medium, or long — depending on how much content they wish to retain. The system is integrated with a user-friendly Streamlit web interface, allowing users to input text directly, or upload PDF and text files for summarization. Additionally, the application processes the documents in real-time and displays the summarized output on the same platform.

The primary objective of this project is to reduce the time and effort required to read and comprehend lengthy textual content by providing concise, meaningful summaries. By leveraging libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and PyPDF2, alongside TF-IDF vectorization techniques, the system effectively identifies and ranks sentences based on their contextual importance within the document. This tool has significant potential applications in journalism, academic research, and corporate settings where quick content review is essential. Future improvements could include the addition of abstractive summarization models, multilingual support, and keyword extraction features to further enhance the system’s versatility and accuracy.
